# STFQ 404 Manager
**STFQ 404 Manager** is a WordPress plugin designed to provide users with a simple solution to customize the behavior of their website's 404 error page. This plugin allows administrators to override the default 404 error page with a custom page chosen from the existing pages on their WordPress site.

Upon activation, the plugin adds a new settings page under the WordPress admin panel's "Settings" menu. On this settings page, administrators can select a page from a dropdown list of existing pages on their site. This selected page will serve as the destination whenever a visitor encounters a 404 error while browsing the website.

Once configured, whenever a visitor lands on a non-existent page, WordPress will automatically redirect them to the page selected by the administrator. This redirection ensures a smoother user experience by directing visitors to relevant content or designated landing pages instead of displaying the standard 404 error message.

"STFQ 404 Manager" simplifies the process of managing 404 error pages, offering website administrators greater control over their site's user experience and navigation flow.
